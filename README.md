# OpenFontFormat

This repo is used to discuss issues related to ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" (OFF) specification.

When filing an issue, please use one of the tags (related to table names, features, etc.) to identify the specific parts of the OFF specification. We hope discussion here will lead to rapid resolution of raised issues.

#### Process Requirements

If you have an idea for how the MPEG Open Font Format (MOFF) specification (spec) can be improved, file an issue on this repo!
There may be related discussions on the [mpeg-otspec](https://lists.aau.at/mailman/listinfo/mpeg-otspec) mailing list, which has a [public archive](https://lists.aau.at/pipermail/mpeg-otspec/) you can search.
(Sadly file attachments are not available in the archive, but you can request copies be reposted by older members, or join MPEG (see below) and then search the MPEG document registry and ISO Livelink document repositories, as access to those document archives is password protected and available only to active members of SC29.)

Issues on Github are easy to track and discuss, with "unread messages" notifications in the web ui for logged in users, tags and milestones for grouping and prioritizing, inline formatting with markdown, images and file attachments with drag and drop, message editing for yourself, and moderation tools to keep discussions within the bound of the code of conduct. 

However, an issue here is just a first step in the journey to an updated specification.
The next step is a proposal for a change.
This could be a Markdown or HTML file contributed via Pull Request to this repo, or could be a file you develop in any format outside this repo. 

Whichever way it happens, once they are ready, all change proposals must be emailed to the mpeg-otspec list for official submission.
There may be further discussion of the proposed text changes on that list, as the chair of the Ad Hoc Group will officially call for comments on that list within a specified time period.
If no objections are raised, the proposal will be deemed to pass consensus, and upgraded in status to a Input Document (ID) and formally submitted to the MOFF Working Group (WG).

The WG will then merge the IDs into a Draft Revision (DR) of the spec, and this will be voted on by the Working Group's parent, SubCommittee 29 (SC29).
The voting is done by national standards bodies, and you can join your country of residence's standards body through your employer, your own company, or as an individual, depending on your country's rules.
