# OpenFontFormat

This repo is used to discuss issues related to ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" (OFF) specification. Participants of the activities and discussions in this repo must follow and adhere to [ISO Code of Conduct](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/store/en/PUB100397.pdf). Participation in the ISO activities is subject to ISO's copyright and data protection policy, which is detailed by the following [Declaration for Participants in ISO Activities](https://www.iso.org/declaration-for-participants-in-iso-activities.html)

The most recent edition of the OFF and the latest amendment are publicly available documents that can be downloaded using the following links:
- [ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" (4th edition)](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c074461_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2019.zip)
- [ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" Amendment 1](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c078865_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2019_Amd_1_2020(en).zip)

The suggested process for a new change proposal (clarificatons, updates, amendments, etc.) is to  start with the currently published OFF text and create a new issue for each change proposal. We can formulate and discuss the proposed changes / text amendments in this repo, and then finalize the text of the proposal as input contribution to SC29/WG3 and share it for final discussion and approval on the AHG mailing list. 

When filing an issue, please use one of the tags (related to table names, features, etc.) to identify the specific parts of the OFF specification. We hope discussion here will lead to rapid resolution of raised issues.
