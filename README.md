This repo is used to discuss issues related to ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" (OFF) specification.

When filing an issue, please use one of the tags (related to table names, features, etc.) to identify the specific parts of the OFF specification. We hope discussion here will lead to rapid resolution of raised issues.

#### Related Info

There may be related discussions on the [mpeg-otspec](https://lists.aau.at/mailman/listinfo/mpeg-otspec) mailing list, which has a [public archive](https://lists.aau.at/pipermail/mpeg-otspec/)

Having ideas for actions filed as issues on Github would definitely make it easier to track and discuss, but it doesnâ€™t preclude a full round trip back to email list for submitting and discussing proposed text changes.
Bug fixes, clarifications, and minor amendments (where few sentences or a paragraph of text is subject to change) can be part of the issue raised, but when the time comes for much more substantial changes (looking back at and remembering 100+ pages of contributions for variable fonts in OFF 4th edition), use this email list for more substantive discussions.
